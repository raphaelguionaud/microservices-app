# microservices-app
Small app with microservice architecture deployed in a Kubernetes cluster, Skaffold dev environment. There is a basic placeholder frontend built in React to allow you to interact with the backend.
The emphasis for this project is on the backend architecture as well as the infrastructure/dev environment setup with Kubernetes and Skaffold allowing for fast and easy build & deployment.

## Quick start
This assumes you have Docker, Kubernetes and Skaffold already installed => Clone the repository, then:
```
cd microservices-app/ && skaffold dev
```
